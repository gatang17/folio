Subsequent steps progressively transform the concept into a structured, styled, interactive, and finally live website.",

The page is designed as a single-page layout with anchor links to different sections, providing a training exercise in organizing content and design with minimal tools. This project focuses on a calm and professional aesthetic, with warm, editorial-style photography, soft colors (greens, beige, cream, golden accents), and clear visual hierarchy. The site is still in development, serving as a practical exercise in layout, structure, and usability within WordPress constraints.",
