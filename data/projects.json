The site showcases my completed projects, including photography and web development work, in a clear and interactive format. The design focuses on simplicity, readability, and user experience, allowing visitors to easily navigate between projects and learn about my skills. Each project dynamically loads its details from a JSON file, demonstrating both my front-end development skills and ability to structure content efficiently. This portfolio serves as a professional presentation of my work and a practical exercise in coding a fully functional, self-managed website.",

Subsequent steps progressively transform the concept into a structured, styled, interactive, and finally live website.",

This project focuses on a calm and professional aesthetic, with warm, editorial-style photography, soft colors (greens, beige, cream, golden accents), and clear visual hierarchy.
